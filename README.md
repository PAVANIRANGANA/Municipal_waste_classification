♻️ CleanTech: Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning

CleanTech is an AI-powered web application designed to classify and manage waste efficiently using image recognition. It leverages **Transfer Learning with VGG16** to predict different types of waste (like plastic, paper, organic, etc.) from uploaded images. Built with Flask, CleanTech provides a simple user interface for users to contribute toward cleaner and smarter waste disposal systems.

 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Image-based Waste Prediction** using a trained VGG16 model.
- 💻 **User-friendly Interface** with a clean design.
- 📂 **Upload Functionality** to test predictions.
- 📊 **Result Page** showing classification outcome.
- 🖼️ Organized **static assets and templates**.
- 🧠 Transfer learning implementation using Keras.

📸 How to Use
Go to the Predict page.

Upload an image of waste.

The model classifies it (e.g., plastic, paper).

See results on the Result page.
